Hello. 

Professor Volt, here. 

I've been always driven by thirst for knowledge, </br>
a fundamental force I always carried, that made me </br>
willing to understand how things work, grasp their </br>
internal mechanism, see how and apply them IRL. </br>

<short funny story, of me as a child, around 5, 6-ish>
#or my historically accurate first bio#</br>
As I was five already I could run arround the house, </br>
outside and basically on most places, but most importantly </br>
in every apartment we went to. And we went a lot. My parrents</br>
were young, they had a lot of friends and out of 6/7 nights</br>
either we had guests, or we were invited at somebodys flat or</br>
house.</br>
</br> 
So, at that point, I already was completely aware of the</br>
fact, that I'm surrounded by super, amazingly</br>
interesting stuf (looked mostly towards household appliances &</br>
other electrical or mechanical apparatuses), that I reaaaly HAD</br>
to understand from the inside. And in ordee to see, examine and understand</br>
something from the inside, one has to open said thing. So my two</br>
favorite "toys" werw a "+" and a "-" screwdrivers, which I always </br>
carried with me arround, everywhere, always, no matter "why" we are</br>
at that place in space/time. You know how some children carry a teddy</br>
bear, called "Ted" around. Well, gues what! My screwdrivers had separate</br>
names, that were invented in respect to the type of the tool! </br>
In Englisch it would sound something in the  lines of: "Plusey" & "Minusey"! </br>
Because for me, it was only based on logic derived from simple observation, </br>
thus clearly obvious, that those were "a plus screwdriver" and</br>
"a minus screwdriver". 

ANYWAAAAY, long story short [ship, sailed. me. in-possession-of-that-knowledge!], 
evwryone of my relatives, all of my parents friends knew, that when I step in their </br>
home, it's waay too late to just start with hidding and/or </br>
elevating all aplliances at a furniture level I can't reach! 

As soon as I got my hands on that landline phone I needed not more</br>
two 180° turns and one baby-proofed curse word worth of time to successfully open</br>
and partly disassemble that thirty-eight piece of marvelous comunistic</br>
engineering, that is completely the same as the previous 37 phones I </br>
opened in under a minute and that split second in which, the light traveling, </br>
reflected by the phones body, straight to my face, touches my eyeballs, the realisation</br>
of the repeatedness (which made every next realiaation twice faster), of the sigth</br>
I witnessed every time I open the-same-fuxking-appliance, so in that split second,</br>
off course I immediately lose all interest and memories of handling it,</br>
thus swiftly escaping every possible liability reading</br>
which in itself gave me the freedom to move in 360°, aimed for the next</br>
target. Some, poor clueless household appliance, that just last year made the </br>
warranty void time based, while thinking:</br>
"Hardest part of my life is over. If I managed to survive</br>
and stay ot of repair-center, for the complete warranty period,</br>
and honestly and hardworkingly served my master, delivering</br>
insanity-level-grade perfect reaults.... </br>
.... the hardest is over! Now it's time to happily</br>
absolve my retirement, in joyful peace & quiet!"


Suddenly... Me... a 5 year old. EXISTS!
