- 👋 Hi, I’m @professor-volt
- 👀 I’m interested in ... lots of things! It took me around 20y to realise to tackle new stuff I want to obtain and master, ONE AT A TIME! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... boosting my emotional intelligence to the "Legendary" TIER, while admiring all the "inventive" and "inteligent" 
ways-to-learn-phsycology-IRL-101 when living with unegucated, egocentric, egoistic, extremely superficial and 
vauge about 99% of life, as we: humans know it so far; extremely volatile and hot-tempered, nano-short fuse/patience, 
totally irrational, complete opposite of logical, intenrionally stupid, the-badder-the-woeser lover, kamikaze huggeer, 
early give-up-per, not super-pritty-but-also-not-the-other-magnetPole face, but skin-hair-erecter ugly on the inside most od the time, 
cuts-ham_&_cheese-with-ZERO-ethical-taste, deliberately impractical, 1st-place-award-winning-word: "SPITE", ofc with all little
extentions, like: sp[Я]ite lover, sp[Я]ite enthusiasts, sp[Я]ite expert (having in mind, sp[Я]ite has NO expert level, since
players of that game only gain reversed points, or anti-exp, looser points; which add or count towards the negative infinity), 
SOON-OF-A-BITCHING _-_-_ (I'll be never ready to shout it, but) GIRL! (I met, already three years ago.) 

For me, it's a paradox: calling this stupid twat, that is indeed my gf, A GIRL(!!!). I'm still suspicious and unsure about the
authenticity of her existence on our planet at this precise point in place/time, since I always thought (and with time,
we boys, proved it ever more, gave yearly examplalatory examples, that in fact: 
BOYZ R MORE STUPID THAN GIRLZ! Or, elegance example: Girls are fucking smarter. And they brain-up earlier and lots quicker than us, boyz. 
Well, myGf turned everything heads down, feet up, nose in Guatemala doing cocke, ass in heaven pooping over rich snobs cars ans years in Peru and Swasiland, getting flirt-whistles from deaf ppl wearing yellow on friday 13!
In a way, EI (emotional_inteligence) levelup delivers me the opportunity to choose to invest time, previously unavailable for me,
in leveling up my Linux, hacking, reverse-ingeneering and generally moddern electronics,touch (not sexually) devices, IoT & I/O boards_&_gadgets, programming skills!
Which basically means that while this stupid bitch is doing herself a collosal disfavor,for intentionally acting aimlessly, out-of-spite and marvelously S.T.U.P.I.D. (even if she's aware, she even get's 
more excited to be and act stupider and stupider), I develop new skills, learn and grow. She, is climbing down to make sure to drop the lever, 
down to levels we thought unreachable) l
